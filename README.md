Internship on Android Application Development - A Quiz Application

Here we provide the users with Quiz on various general knowledge
topics. In this application we learn to use various Layout components at the
same time understanding them better.

In the app, questions would be asked and answers would be shown as
multiple choices. The user selects the answer and gets shown on the screen
if the answers are correct. In the end the final marks would be shown to the
users.
